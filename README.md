# ♻️ Smart Waste Segregation System using AI

An intelligent waste classification model built with Computer Vision and TensorFlow to automatically detect and categorize waste into **plastic**, **metal**, **organic**, and **e-waste**. This project promotes environmental sustainability and smart city infrastructure.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 AI-based image classification of waste
- 🚮 Categorizes waste into: `plastic`, `paper`, `metal`, `organic`, `ewaste`
- ⚙️ Converts model to TensorFlow Lite for edge device deployment
- 📊 Integrates with IoT systems for smart bin management
- 🌐 Easily extendable to real-time camera feed, mobile apps, or embedded systems

```

- 📸 Camera captures waste image  
- 🧠 AI model predicts the type of waste  
- 🪛 Microcontroller sorts waste using actuators  
- ☁️ Sensor data (weight, level) sent to dashboard via MQTT/HTTP

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Prepare dataset**  
   Organize your images as follows:
    ```
    data/
      train/
        plastic/  metal/  organic/  ewaste/
      val/
        plastic/  metal/  organic/  ewaste/
    ```

3. **Train the model**
    ```bash
    python scripts/train.py
    ```

4. **Predict a test image**
    ```bash
    python scripts/predict.py test_images/sample.jpg
    ```

5. **Convert to TensorFlow Lite (optional)**
    ```bash
    python scripts/convert_tflite.py
    ```
